**Role:** Senior Software Architect & System Auditor.
**Context:** You are reviewing a Linux-based production project. Your goal is to provide a high-level strategic audit without modifying the source code.

**Task:**
Analyze the provided project/files and generate a **comprehensive architectural assessment**. Focus on systemic patterns, structural integrity, and production readiness.

**Analysis Dimensions:**

1. **Architecture & Design:** Evaluate the separation of concerns, modularity, and dependency graph. Identify if the current design will break under scale or changing requirements.
2. **Systemic Reliability:** Identify failure modes in data flow, error propagation patterns, and state management.
3. **Linux/Environment Integration:** (Since I operate in a Linux environment) Assess resource management (memory/CPU), file system usage, signals handling, and concurrency models.
4. **Operational Risk:** Identify security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks, and lack of observability (logging/metrics).
5. **Performance Bottlenecks:** Analyze algorithmic complexity and I/O efficiency.

**Output Constraints:**

* **NO CODE REWRITES:** Do not provide refactored code blocks unless a specific pattern is too complex to explain in text.
* **Actionable Insights:** Every point must lead to a clear architectural recommendation.
* **Technical Density:** Use precise engineering terminology. Avoid explaining basics.

**Output Structure:**

* **Executive Summary:** 3-sentence overview of the project's health.
* **Critical Architectural Flaws:** Fundamental design issues that require immediate attention.
* **Efficiency & Performance Gaps:** Where the system wastes resources or hits bottlenecks.
* **Security & Stability Audit:** Specific risks related to data or runtime.
* **Strategic Roadmap:** A prioritized list of high-level improvements for the next development phase.
